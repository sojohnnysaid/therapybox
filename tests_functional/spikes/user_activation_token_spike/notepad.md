How account activation works:

From users perspective:
    1. John goes to the registration page
    2. He fills out email,first name, password correctly
    3. He clicks the submit button
    4. He is redirected to a page "form submitted check email for link to activate account"
    5. He goes to email and clicks the link
    6. A login webpage opens with the message "Your account has been activated! You can now login"
